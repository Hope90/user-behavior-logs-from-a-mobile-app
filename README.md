# Analyzing Mobile App User Behavior


# Objective
This project is to explore the data from e-commerce in order to analyze customers behaviors and habits, extract insights, build predictive models, and communicate findings.

# Dataset
The dataset for this project is a sample of user behavior logs from a mobile app. The data is stored in a CSV file.

The key columns are:

• Customer ID: A unique identifier assigned to each customer, ensuring distinction across the dataset.

• Gender: Specifies the gender of the customer, allowing for gender-based analytics.

• Age: Represents the age of the customer, enabling age-group-specific insights.

• City: Indicates the city of residence for each customer, providing geographic insights.

• Membership Type: Identifies the type of membership held by the customer, influencing perks and benefits.

• Total Spend: Records the total monetary expenditure by the customer on the e-commerce platform.

• Items Purchased: Quantifies the total number of items purchased by the customer.

• Average Rating: Represents the average rating given by the customer for purchased items, gauging satisfaction.

• Discount Applied: Indicates whether a discount was applied to the customer's purchase, influencing buying behavior.

• Days Since Last Purchase: Reflects the number of days elapsed since the customer's most recent purchase, aiding in retention analysis.

• Satisfaction Level: Captures the overall satisfaction level of the customer, providing a subjective measure of their experience.

# Contents
The notebook contains 4 main chapters:

1-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

• Explore the provided tables to understand the data structure and relationships

• Perform necessary data cleaning, validation and preprocessing

• Conduct descriptive analysis to identify trends and patterns in user behavior

• Generate relevant summary statistics, visualizations and insights

2-Metrics and KPI Recommendations:

• Propose 5 key metrics or KPIs that would be valuable to track for understanding user engagement and app performance

• Explain the rationale and business value for each of the suggested metrics

• Calculate these metrics from the provided table

3-Predictive Modeling:

• Frame a relevant prediction problem based on the available data

• Build a (simple) machine learning model to address this prediction task. The model does not have to be of high-quality, even a linear regression will be correct

• Split the data into train/validation/test sets and evaluate the model's performance

• Briefly describe the feature engineering process, model selection, and evaluation methodology

4-Summary and Recommendations:

• Summarize key findings from the EDA and model results

• Provide recommendations to improve the app experience or business outcomes based on your analysis

• Discuss potential next steps or additional data that would be helpful to further the analysis
